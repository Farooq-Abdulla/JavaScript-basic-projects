Here i've noticed that the '+' operator in java script works little differently.
When i used "num.innerText=num.innerText-1;" there was no problem subtracting but when i used "num.innerText=num.innerText+1;" i saw that + 1 isn't added but it was concatinated instead. 
So to avoid it i used "num.innerText++;"


I haven't used these commands prior this
