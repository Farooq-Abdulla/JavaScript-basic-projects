# Portfolio
Here I've tried to get the photos from API , so that this page will have infinite profiles. I've got the api to get random photos ("https://100k-faces.glitch.me/random-image"). Each time when I open the page by using this link, I was seeing a new pic which I dont want.
What I want is, there should be a fixed opening page and when I hit the right button or left button i should be getting new images with new names.

# New Concepts Learnt
I've learnt about the "object-fit: cover" command, which will keep the image look clean(it won't stretch or shrink the image)

# Pseudo Code
I've created a Object literal which has multipe objects with details of the person such as name, img link, job position and some text. Then by accessing the keys of the object, I've assigned it to the already present html tags, ids and classes
